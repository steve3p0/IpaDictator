The IPA Dictator
================

This android mobile app will transcribe what you say or type in English into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

Currently I am having issues deploying the app with an APK, without it crashing.  If I run it one time in debug mode from Visual Studio 2015 on an Android device, it will continue to work on that device unplugged.
